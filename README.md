## Users can:

- Create objects with specified properties, each of which will affect how the object behaves according to the laws of physics and environmental forces.
  - Mass
  - Charge
  - Size
  - Friction Coefficient
  - Initial velocities
- Adjust the global gravity
- Clear objects
- Choose presets, or demos, which will set the environment and pre-place different scenarios that can then be interacted with normally.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
  - Paper.js for rendering shapes and checking for overlaps to initiate unit collision handling
- HTML5
  - Canvas
- SCSS
